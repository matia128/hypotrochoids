# hypotrochoids
A web page for generating hypotrochoids and epitrochoids using rotating vectors.

Hypotrochoids and epitrochoids can be created by rotating and summing two vectors. This web page allows for a higher number of vectors as well, which creates more complex and intricate shapes. The parameters that can be controled be the user are the ratios between the frequencies of the vectors; the ratios between the magnitudes of the vectors; the angle step, which controls the smoothness of the curve; as well as various cosmetic controls.
